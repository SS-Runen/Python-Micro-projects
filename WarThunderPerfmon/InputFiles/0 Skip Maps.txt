Second Battle of El Alamein [Battle] - Only good for low tier. The miniaturized version cuts out easy access to the sniping platforms of the domination version while putting the spawns so close to each other that it is easy to avoid the open space and capture either zone.

Un-announced changes to Hellfire spalling. Mostly untested.

Additional modules added to many vehicles, including autoloader racks. There were at least two incidents where ammunition in the rack was not detonated. It could be due to the ammunition position being switched from upright to parallel with the floor, but it could also be reduced cook-off chance due to the auto-loader (carousel, other smaller modules announced with "Seek and Destroy").

Until the ratio of good maps to bad maps returns to the mid-2023 ratio where ten matches guaranteed at least one good map, respawns are now allowed even for long-range deaths. Wagers used to be plausible despite skipping maps if they gave ten chances for failure.

The current ratio of good maps to bad maps is 4 out of 50 based on this list:
https://wiki.warthunder.com/Category:Maps_and_missions#General_Ground_Forces_Maps

Since Fire Arc is limited to BR 6.0 and below as of September 2024 and Mozdok [Battle] is only good for 6.0 and below, only two maps out of 50 are good for BR 7.0 and above.

Maps with at least one good spawn point were counted as one good map. The availability of maps per battle rating was not considered to simplify calculations. Maps with at least one good variant are treated as one good map unless the variant was separately listed in the WarThunder Wiki article. It can also change easily with an update. This is why Fire Arc was included in the count of good maps despite only appearing in BRs of 6.0 and below. The other good maps are Second Battle of El Alamein, a.k.a El Alamein, Pradesh, and Mozdok. Mozdok [Battle] has a good side for battle ratings 8.0 and below.

By the same standard, there were 6-7 good maps out of 48 in early to mid-2023. Mozdok Domination, European Province, a.k.a Eastern Europe (with the windmill hill sniper's spot), Sands of Sinai, and Fields of Poland had at least one viable spawn. Fire Arc used to be available for all tiers, not just 6.0 and below (Tiger E and below).

Middle East and Maginot line were destroyed on or before 2023.
