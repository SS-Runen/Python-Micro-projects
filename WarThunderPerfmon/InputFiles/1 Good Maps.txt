Pradesh #2

Pradesh #1
- C point and B point are both urban in this version. Neither can be shot at from long range.

Second Battle of El Alamein #1 [Domination]
- Unlike the Battle version, the zones cannot all be accessed thru cover. A point can be shot at from long distance and multiple angles, though some spots require going thru close-range combat and can be close range flanked easily.
