- Always use sight over 3rd-person against ground targets.
- When moving past uncleared areas, move slow enough to clear thoroughly and to be able to fire accurately.
- When scanning for targets, always stay hull down or have most of the tank hidden.
- If the uncleared area is large, have something to cover you from a large portion of it and clear what is left.
- If you cannot reliably clear an area and there is no safe route past it (e.g. a large town in open field) do not expose yourself to it.
- When leading close-range targets, make sure that the shell will hit the target whether or not it continues moving. Impossible to do at long range.
- When firing, "bracket" the target: have as much of the target within the upper and lower "spread". Despite slight range errors, round will hit.
- When scanning for targets, always keep most of the tank hidden. The most exposure should be from a hull-down position.
- Always watch for shell "splash" or hits before losing sight of a target.
- When a target is showing a significant part of its side, APDS is usually a safer shell to use than HESH.
- When shell splash appears behind target, check if shell went past its turret. If so, adjust range by half a mark (100 meters).
