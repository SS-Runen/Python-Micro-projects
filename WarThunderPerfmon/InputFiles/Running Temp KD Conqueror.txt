## Gunnery
- Always use sight and machine gun over 3rd-person against ground targets when firing.
- When leading close-range targets, make sure that the shell will hit the target whether or not it continues moving.
- When firing, "bracket" the target: have as much of the target within the upper and lower "spread".
Despite slight range errors, round will hit.
- Always watch for shell "splash" or hits before losing sight of a target.
- When a target is showing a significant part of its side, APDS is usually safer to use than HESH.

## Scannning and Searching
- When scanning for targets, always stay hull down or have most of the tank hidden.
- If the uncleared area is large, have something to cover you from a large portion of it and clear what is left.
- Use third-person (3rd person view from turret top) when scanning extremely close areas.
Switch to high-zoom if an area stands out, e.g. it is far but in line of sight.
- When scanning for targets, always keep most of the tank hidden. The most exposure should be from a hull-down position.

## Positioning and Movement
- When moving past uncleared areas, move slow enough to clear thoroughly and to be able to fire accurately.
- If you cannot reliably clear an area and there is no safe route past it (e.g. a large town in open field)
do not expose yourself to it.
- Always keep as much of the vehicle hidden as possible whether moving or waiting.
