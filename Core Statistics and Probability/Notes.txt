Data

Continuous data: Data for which the granularity of the measurement can be changed. These values could have an infinite range of granularity.
Categorical data: Values are set and there are no "in-between" data values/ranges.

Levels of Data Measurement:
Nominal - Categorical and cannot be ordered/sorted.
Ordinal - Categorical and can be ordered/sorted. Cannot provide scale, i.e. 1 vs. 2 vs. 6.
Interval - Provides scale and lacks a zero point/floor. Degrees Celsius/Fahrenheit have no "true zero point" or floor. Kelvins have a true zero point since Kelvin does not measure temperature with negative values.
Ratio - Provide scale, can be ordered (just like interval levels of measure) and have a true zero point. E.g. age, population.

Population - All members of a certain group.
Sample - A subset of a specific group.

Covariance - The "direction" of the relationship between two variables, i.e. a value that indicates whether two variables are positively or negatively/inversely correlated. It cannot accurately tell the strength of the correlation. The more distant (negatively or positively) from zero, the higher the covariance value. To use covariance in measuring the degree/strength of correlation, the values have to be normalized/scaled based on each sets values relative magnitude. Refer to:

Pearson Correlation Coefficient - Measures the strength of the association or relation of two variables. It gives the magnitude and direction of a correlation. Refer to Excercise01-Data-ANSERS or:

Properties of Factorials

Negative numbers do not have a factorial.

The value of 0! is set at 1.

n! = (n-1)! * n

(n + 1)! = n! * n

(n + k)! = n! * (n + 1) * ...(n + k)

(n - k)! = n! / ((n - k + 1) * (n - k + 2) * ...(n - k + k)) or n! / ((n - k + 1) * (n - k + 2) * ...n)

Assuming n > k, n! / k! = (k + 1) * (k + 2) * ...n

Combinatorics

Variation with Repetition/Replacement - Assumes a set with n number of elements permuted p at a time but each element is replaced/may be used repeatedly. In other words, filling a number of "slots" or "positions" with elements from a certain set while allowing repeated use of any element. v = n^p where n is the number of available elements and p is the number of positions to fill.

Variations without Repetition - Denoted by v = n! / (n-p)! where n is the number of usable elements and p is the number of positions to fill. Synonymous to "permutations of n number of elements taken p at a time without replacement." Note that n! denotes the total permutations of all usable elements. (n - p)! denotes permutations of elements that are not going to be used to fill in positions. This implies that a variation without replacement is the number of times the permutation of unused elements can be subtracted from the permutation of all elements.

Combinations - To get the number of unique sets/combinations (C) for a number of elements (n) taken (p) at a time, nCp = n! / (p! * (n-p)!).

Symmetry of Combinations - n C r = n C (n - r). E.g. 10C7 = 10C3.

Measures of Central Tendency

Mean/Arithmetic Mean - The sum of values in a set divided by the count of values. It can be influenced significantly by outliers. Population mean is usually denoted by μ and sample mean by x or x-bar.

Geometric mean - The product of all values in a set raised to the (1/n)th power, with n being the number of values in the set. μ = (n1 * n2 * ...n)^(1/n) or μ = n√(n1 * n2 * ...n). The term 1/n denotes the nth root, e.g. 1/2 denotes the square root. This mean is often used to calculate growth over time. It can be referred to as the time-weighted rate of return. Unlike the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean can be used to measure compounding. E.g. for [2, 18], geometric μ = (2*18)^1/2. For [2, 18, 20, 25], geometric μ = (2*18*20*25)^(1/4).

Median - The middle value or the average of the two middle values of an ordered set.

Mode - The most frequent value in a set.

The mean is usually more affected by outliers with a high absolute value.

Percentile - A value which a certain percentage of values in a set are less than. I.e. the 10th percentile denotes a value compared to which 10% of all values in the set are lower.

Quartile - Usually arbitrarily set at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.

++++++++++++++++++++++
Measures of Dispersion

Range - Difference between maximum and minimum value of a set.

Variance - The average of the squared distances from the mean of all data points. The sum of squared distance from the mean of each point divided by either sample size less one (n - 1) or population size. Sample variance s^2 requires the use of (n - 1) as denominator. Population variance σ^2 uses population count n. Here, n is the number of data points/elements in the sample or population.

Standard Deviation - The square root of a sets variance. The set may be a sample s or population σ.

*Bessel's Correction:
- The use of (n - 1) as a denominator to reduce bias due to finite sample size.

Inter-quartile Range - A basis for calculating a fence for marking outliers. The fence is often arbitrarily set to 1.5 times the inter-quartile range (IQR). IQR is the distance between the lower limit in quartile 1 and the upper limit in quartile 3. Outliers are either higher by 1.5 times the IQR compared to the lower limit of the 3rd quartile or lower by 1.5 times the IQR compared to the lower limit of the 1st quartile.

Z-score - The number of standard deviations from the mean to a certain value.

Coefficient of Variation - This is an indicator of how much "spread" your data has. Standard deviation divided by mean and multiplied by 100%. C = (standard_deviation / mean) * 100%.

Probability

Union - The probability of either A or B occuring. Calculated using the formula for the Addition Rule for Probabilities.

Intersection - The probability that two events/results A and B both occur, i.e. both hypotheses are simultaneously true. For events, multiply prbability of A with that of B to get the probabilities. P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B).

Addition Rule for Probabilities - The probability of A or B occuring, P(A U B), is given by: P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). For mutually exclusive events, ommit `P(A ∩ B)`. P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B).

Multiplication Rule for Independent Events - If A and B are independent, P (A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)

Multiplication Rule for Dependent Events - Where event A is dependent on B, i.e. B -> A, P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A). This may be rephrased as the probability of A given that B has occured. The formula is equivalent to: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).

Expected Outcome = The expected numerical result E of an experiment for an event A. Denoted as E(A). For categorical results, E(A) = P(A) * n, where n is the number of trials performed.

- Conditional Probability

-- For dependent events A and B

The probability of B given A, i.e. P(B) if A has happened:
P(B|A) = P(B ∩ A) / P(A)
~ The probability of B given A is equal to the probability of B intersection A divided by the probability of A.

The probability of A given B, i.e. P(B) happening if A has happened/will happen:
P(A|B) = P(B ∩ A) / P(B)
~ The probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A intersection B divided by the probability of B.

* The probability of the event "taken for granted" or assumed to happen will be the denominator of the probability of A intersection B.

-- For two events A and B, if the probability of A is the same as the probability of A given B, the events are independent.
P(A) = P(A|B) ~ independent
P(B) = P(B|A) ~ independent
P(A) != P(A|B) ~ dependent

Discrete Distributions

Binomial Distribution Probability Mass Function - Describes the probability of observing x successes in total after performing n trials. The term (n x) denotes a combination of n taken x at a time.

Poisson Disribution Probability Mass and Cumulative Mass Function - Probability of getting x successes per some continuous unit, e.g. time or distance. To get the probability of x or less/more successes, simply sum the poisson distributions of x and below or x and above. The poisson distribution assumes uniformity of the intervals between success. If there is a reason for events or successes to occur with varying intervals - e.g. at a the end of 5 PM and during the first minutes of 8 AM - the poisson distribution cannot be used effectively.

++++++++++++++++++++++++
Continuous Distributions

Normal/Guassian/Bell-curve distribution - Maps probabilities to an area x. Probabilities cannot be mapped to a single specific outcome and have to be mapped to a range or interval instead. In a continuous normal distribution, the mean, median and mode are equal. Regardless of what the mean, median, or mode are, all normal distributions are centered and symmetric around the mean.

Standard normal distribution - A normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

Exercise
1. A distribution is a range of probabilities mapped to a value. They display the probability of getting a result (y-axis) equal to a certain value (x-axis).
5. x=2, n=5, p=0.5
10. 0.9961696194324102

Sampling

- An aribtrary minimum sample count is > 30.

Selection Bias - Bias toward selecting samples more likely to react or respond to polls, surverys, and other data gathering requests or sampling techniques. Examples: Undercoverage Bias: omitting a segment of the population. Self-selection bias: A bias caused by differences between people who volunteer themselves as samples compared to those who don't volutneer. Healthy-user bias.

Survivorship Bias - Skewed resutls samples that are inferior, damaged, or unobservable "leaving" the sample pool or not being included or removed from the sample pool.

Random Sampling - All population members have an equal chance of being selected.
Staratifed Sampling - A population is sorted into segments based on certain characteristics. Members cannot belong to two or more groups. From each group, take a sample. The sample size from each group must have the same ratio to the total sample size as the group's ratio to the total population.

Clustering - The population is broken into groups and samples are taken from a random selection of groups. The group sample size ratio to total sample size must be the same as group size ratio to population size.
