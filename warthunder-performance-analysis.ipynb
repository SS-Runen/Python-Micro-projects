Remarks on Exploratory Analysis\n","\n","- More data is needed. The average kill distance for the T-44-100 is .76 kilometers while the average killed-by distance is 1.08. Further, the kill and killed-by distances of the T-44-100 are greater than for the T-54 series (1949 and 1947) despite the 1947 having better armor and the 1949 having better shells.\n","\n","- There is a presumed reason for the T-54 (1949) being killed at a longer range (0.75) than the T-54 (1947) despite the 1949 series having better ammunition for long range. Since the 1949 series is generally better than the 1947, it is spawned first. Once killed, the enemy players have an approximate idea of where the player is and manage to get close more often thanks to knowledge gained while in the 1949. This is an unproven explanation and may require an additional column/parameter to be verified.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.075527,"end_time":"2022-02-02T00:51:15.250663","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-02T00:51:15.175136","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Update\n","- As of August 17, 2021, the engagment distance between the Centurion and T-54 series has changed.
