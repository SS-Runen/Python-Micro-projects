General Guidelines

- When testing a formula or procedure, try the process using some input. For equations, try to find a trend in the results relative to the input. For ML algorithms, run limited tests on groups or sets with at least thirty samples. Depending on the situation, a control may be needed or the same data has to be used for different processes.

- To start Spyder in Ubuntu Linux:
conda activate spyder-env
spyder

Here, "spyder-env" is the name of your Conda environment. This is the default name and it may be changed.

- A plugin is needed to open and edit notebooks in Spyder:
conda install spyder-notebook -c conda-forge
