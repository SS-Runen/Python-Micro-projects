General Guidelines

- When testing a formula or procedure, try the process using some input. For equations, try to find a trend in the results relative to the input. For ML algorithms, run limited tests on groups or sets with at least thirty samples. Depending on the situation, a control may be needed or the same data has to be used for different processes.
