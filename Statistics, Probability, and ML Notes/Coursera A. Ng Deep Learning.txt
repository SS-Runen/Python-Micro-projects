General Guidelines

- When testing a formula or procedure, try the process using some input. For equations, try to find a trend in the results relative to the input. For ML algorithms, run limited tests on groups or sets with at least thirty samples. Depending on the situation, a control may be needed or the same data has to be used for different processes.

- The derivative of the cumulative cost function J(vector(w), vector(x)) takes the average loss for the training set. Because of that, the derivative of the cumulative cost function with respect to a parameter w is the average of derivatives for the per-item loss function L(p̂ - p) where p̂ is the prediction and p is the correct value or label.
