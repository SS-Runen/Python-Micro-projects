FhaZe - No response to pings for baron despite me spamming for 2 minutes and enemy team only haveing two dragons.
UntamedSupermacy - No repsonse to alert pings for baron. Went to gank top lane despite top being behind and mid ahead.
Neekolas - As Darius, went AFK after contributing four deaths and one kill. Name-calling in all-chat after the loss.
E Tooth Gaming - As Yasuo, fed a total of 14 kills. Kept going in with no backup and missed Qs even point blank.
