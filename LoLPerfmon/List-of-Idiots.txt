FhaZe - No response to pings for baron despite me spamming for 2 minutes and enemy team only haveing two dragons.
UntamedSupermacy - No repsonse to alert pings for baron. Went to gank top lane despite top being behind and mid ahead.
Neekolas - As Darius, went AFK after contributing four deaths and one kill. Name-calling in all-chat after the loss.
E Tooth Gaming - As Yasuo, fed a total of 14 kills. Kept going in with no backup and missed Qs even point blank.
Great Tempest - Garen. Lost 1 v 1 versus Irelia despite having ignite and Irelia having TP. Kept trying to fight and asking for ganks.
Simp4KimDahyun - Fed the midlane Kai Sa as Katarina then did nothing. Still moved around the map to prevent ability to remake or mitigate loss.
I am Kim Dahyun - Teemo. Fed Nasus 1-11 and still took camps for no reason. Not pre-emptive, took them while wave could be pushed. No communication.
Green Lantern - Original name is Gr(e^)en Lantern. Locked in Fiora despite being support. No consent from our top. Went to duo-lane top.
