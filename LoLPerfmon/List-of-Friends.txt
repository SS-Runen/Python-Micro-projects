Talonn - An Elise who managed to play two zero-death games at Silver III - II. Some Maokai and Yi victories.

starbfly - Renggar. This player played his first three provisional ranked matches at Silver I. Once, he went 18-1 as Renggar.

official Ryu CJ - As Jayce, this player roamed for most of the game and somehow got more than three kills while losing around thirty CS maximum. He did need me to hold top, but it did not hurt much. We only lost a dragon.
